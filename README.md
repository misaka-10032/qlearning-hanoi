qlearning-hanoi
===============

It's an approach of reinforcement learning to hanoi, which involves encoding and iterating. Input cannot be too large; more than 8 plates and 4 sticks (exclusive, at least that works on my browser) could exhaust the browser. Maybe it would accept larger input if implemented in C, yet still limited as the number of states grows exponentially with the input, which would be memory consuming. After all the program is not intended for hanoi, but for an experience of qlearning. 

The canvas feature of html5 and OOP feature of javascript are used. They are REAL amazing and easy to pick up.
